# DS & AI Repository  

This repository is my personal collection of everything I study and practice in **Data Science & Artificial Intelligence**.  
It contains well-structured code, notes, and simple implementations of fundamental concepts that can be useful for beginners and as a quick reference for revision.  

### ðŸ“Œ What's inside?
- Basics of Python for DS & AI  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization  
- Statistics & Probability essentials  
- Machine Learning algorithms (implemented from scratch + libraries)  
- Deep Learning fundamentals  
- Small projects & experiments  

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The main idea behind this repo is to **consolidate learnings** and keep a handy set of codes that can help me (and others) revise or build a strong foundation in DS & AI.
